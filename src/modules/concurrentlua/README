				 ConcurrentLua

Description

  ConcurrentLua is a system that implements a concurrency model for the Lua
  programming language. It is based on the share-nothing asynchronous
  message-passing model that is employed in the Erlang programming language.

  ConcurrentLua extends Lua's coroutines with message-passing primitives, in
  order to support concurrent programming. Distributed programming is supported
  transparently with the same message-passing primitives.

  ConcurrentLua is implemented as a collection of Lua modules that can be
  loaded by any Lua program. Most of the code is written in Lua itself, with
  minor parts written in C.
